# Basics

1. Write a PHP script to redirect a user to a different page
2. Write a e PHP script to display string, values within a table. For example:

| Name  | Age  |
| ----- | ---- |
| John  | 20   |
| Mary  | 30   |
| Smith | 45   |
| Max   | 35   |

3. $d = 'A00'. Using this variable print the following numbers:

   A01
   A02
   A03
   A04
   A05

4. Write a PHP function that takes a number and returns true if that number is greater than 20 or false otherwise using ternary operator

5. Write a PHP program to swap two variables. (For example to swap variables **a** and **b** means that **a** ends up with the value of **b** and **b** with the value of **a**).

6. Write a PHP program to check if a number is an Armstrong number or not. Return true if the number is Armstrong otherwise return false.
   **Note:** An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer so that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number since 1******3 + 5******3 + 3**3 = 153

7. Write a PHP program to convert word to digit.

8. Write a PHP program to check the bits of the two given positions of a number are same or not. 

   For example, 112 - > 01110000

   Test 2nd and 3rd position
   Result: True
   Test 4th and 5th position
   Result: False

9. Write a PHP program to remove duplicates from a sorted list.

   For example,

   Input: (1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5)
   Output: (1,2,3,4,5)

10. Write a PHP program to compute the sum of the digits of a number. 

11. Write a program that returns the sum of all multiples of 5 between 0 and 1000.
